# Roman number converter
This is a webpage that takes user input number and converts it to a Roman numeral.

## About
The project is basically a study of getting the concept of a BDD skills(Behavior Driven Development).

The specs for the program logic are:
1. The number 1 is converted to I and so is any additional number after 1 i.e. number 2 becomes roman numeral II.

1. Larger numbers ending with 0 have their own special Roman numerals i.e.
    1.  I  -    1
    1.  V  -    5
    1.  X  -    10
    1.  L  -    50
    1.  C  -    100
    1.  D  -    500
    1.  M  -    1,000
